VUStrip
===

> Yet another VU meter.. This time is stereo, 20 RGB leds per channel, works over WiFi (no more slow-ass BT) and has a standalone desktop client that captures the system audio through the desktopCapturer API (No more virtual hardware interfaces nonsense).

This is still a WIP and not production ready, though.
It has some hardcoded stuff like the board IP address in the client.

Improvements/Fixes & Photo/Video coming soon...
